# GitHubFileStorage

A Node.js library for interacting with GitHub repositories to manage file storage. With this package, you can upload, download, list, and delete files from your GitHub repositories. Additionally, it supports the ability to download all files from a folder and package them into a ZIP file.

## Installation

To install the package, use npm:

```bash
npm install github-file-storage
```

## Usage

### Requirements

- **GitHub repository**: The repository you want to interact with (e.g., `username/repository`).
- **GitHub Personal Access Token**: You must generate a GitHub personal access token with appropriate permissions. [Create a token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) if you don't have one.

### Example

#### 1. **Creating an instance**

```javascript
const GitHubFileStorage = require('github-file-storage');
const storage = new GitHubFileStorage('username/repository', 'your-github-token');
```

#### 2. **Upload a file**

Uploads a file to the repository in Base64 format. If the file already exists, you can choose whether to overwrite it.

```javascript
const fileContent = 'base64-encoded-file-content-here';
const response = await storage.upload(fileContent, 'folder-path', 'filename.txt', true); // Overwrite is true
console.log(response.message); // "File uploaded successfully!" or "File updated successfully!"
```

#### 3. **List files in a repository or a specific folder**

List all files in the repository, or files from a specific folder.

```javascript
const response = await storage.listFiles('folder-path');
console.log(response.files); // Array of file objects
```

#### 4. **List all files including subdirectories**

This function lists all files recursively within a folder.

```javascript
const allFiles = await storage.listAllFiles('folder-path');
console.log(allFiles); // Array of file objects
```

#### 5. **Download a specific file**

Download a specific file either by URL or as base64 content.

```javascript
const fileResponse = await storage.download('folder-path', 'filename.txt');
console.log(fileResponse.data); // Base64 content or direct URL
```

#### 6. **Download all files in a folder as a ZIP**

Download all files in a folder and package them into a ZIP file.

```javascript
const zipFilePath = await storage.downloadAll('folder-path', './local-storage-path');
console.log('ZIP file created at: ', zipFilePath); // Path to the generated ZIP file
```

#### 7. **Delete a file**

Delete a file from the repository.

```javascript
const deleteResponse = await storage.deleteFile('folder-path', 'filename.txt');
console.log(deleteResponse.message); // "File deleted successfully!"
```

#### 8. **Get file content in Base64**

Fetch the content of a file as a Base64-encoded string.

```javascript
const content = await storage.getContentBase64('folder-path', 'filename.txt');
console.log(content); // { content: 'base64-content', filename: 'filename.txt' }
```
